        Constructor
        ExtrudeGeometry(shapes : Array, options : Object)
        shapes — Shape or an array of shapes.
        options — Object that can contain the following parameters.
        
        curveSegments — int. Number of points on the curves. Default is 12.
        steps — int. Number of points used for subdividing segments along the depth of the extruded spline. Default is 1.
        depth — float. Depth to extrude the shape. Default is 100.
        bevelEnabled — bool. Apply beveling to the shape. Default is true.
        bevelThickness — float. How deep into the original shape the bevel goes. Default is 6.
        bevelSize — float. Distance from the shape outline that the bevel extends. Default is bevelThickness - 2.
        bevelOffset — float. Distance from the shape outline that the bevel starts. Default is 0.
        bevelSegments — int. Number of bevel layers. Default is 3.
        extrudePath — THREE.Curve. A 3D spline path along which the shape should be extruded. Bevels not supported for path extrusion.
        UVGenerator — Object. object that provides UV generator functions
        This object extrudes a 2D shape to a 3D geometry.
        
        When creating a Mesh with this geometry, if you'd like to have a separate material used for its face and its extruded sides, you can use an array of materials. The first material will be applied to the face; the second material will be applied to the sides.
